# Employee Tracker

## Description

The purpose of this project is to give a business owner the ability to manage their company by keeping track of all their employees, roles, and departments. This project utilizes node.js so that it can be run outisde of the client's browser and so that a user does not have to interact with a UI in order to use this application. This project also uses inquirer.js as a command line for the user so that they can easily input the correct employee, role, and department information asked for. In order to keep all this information organized, mysql2 is used so that the data can be stored in a database with tables for the employees, roles, and departments. This also allows for the tables to be connected with foreign keys to easily display and update information across tables. Console.table is used so that when a user wants to view all employees, roles, or departments, it is formatted in a way that is easy to read.
